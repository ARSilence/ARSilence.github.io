  <h1>Privacy Policy for TišinaAR</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 10, 2023</p>
  <h2>Developer Information</h2>
  <p>Developed by Franjo Badurina, Boris Hergesic, and Ivica Škrobo.</p>
  <p>For any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:arsetup55@gmail.com">arsetup55@gmail.com</a>.</p>
  
  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>TišinaAR does not collect any personally identifiable information from its users. The app relies on Unity's automatic logging for diagnostic and performance purposes, which is not used to identify individual users.</p>
  
  <h2>Log Data</h2>
  <p>We want to inform you that TišinaAR does not explicitly log any user data. Any data that is logged automatically by Unity is for diagnostic and performance purposes only and is not used to identify individual users.</p>
  
  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. TišinaAR does not use these “cookies” explicitly.</p>
  
  <h2>Service Providers</h2>
  <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To facilitate TišinaAR;</li>
    <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
    <li>To assist us in analyzing how TišinaAR is used.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We want to inform users of TišinaAR that these third parties may have access to Unity's automatic logs, which are not used to identify individual users.</p>
  
  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We value your trust in using TišinaAR, and we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting any data that is automatically logged by Unity.</p>
  
  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>
